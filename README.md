### Simulation Study for occupancy models

This repo contains the code for simulations to explore occupancy model mis-fits in more detail.

It contains the following files:

- SimpleSims.R - Some simple simulations. It should provide a workflow for what follows
- ToDo.md - explanation of what we need to do

- R/SimOcc.R - function to simulate a occupancy data.
